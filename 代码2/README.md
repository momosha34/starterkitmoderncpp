File Handling with Smart Pointers
File Handling and Smart Pointers
This paragraph introduces the role of smart pointers in file handling, explaining how they control the lifespan of file objects and prevent accidental connections to files. When smart pointers go out of scope, they automatically call the destructor of the object (here, the TFile destructor) to close the file.

File Reading Example
 Provides a code example demonstrating how to use smart pointers to read a file and retrieve objects. The example utilizes std::unique_ptr to manage the file object's lifecycle, explaining how the file is automatically closed when the scope ends and how to disconnect the retrieved object from the file.
 
Plotting Example
 Offers another code example showing how to draw a histogram object read from a file in memory.
Checking if the File Is Still Open
Author contribution: Presents a simple code snippet to check whether the file remains open by verifying if the gFile pointer is directed at a valid memory address.
